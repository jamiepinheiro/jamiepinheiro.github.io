title: A little about myself
---

I'm a Computer Science student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca).

Previously, I've interned as a Software Engineer at [Jane Street](https://janestreet.com), [Instagram](https://instagram.com), [Google](https://google.com), [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) and [Faire](https://faire.com), working on a range of problems from building powerful developer tools, to scaling large distributed systems. Feel free to take a look at my [resume](/Resume.pdf) for more on my experience.

In my free time, I love to ski, explore new food, lift weights, and play/watch basketball. More recently, I've been enjoying listening to discourse on [Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/) (feel free to follow me @jpinheiro ðŸ‘‹).
